# Securing a Virtual Small Business Network

## **Project Description**
This project demonstrates the setup, vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and hardening of a virtual small business network using BlackArch Linux. The goal is to simulate real-world attack scenarios and implement effective security measures to secure the network.

## **Features**
- Virtualized network environment with Ubuntu Server, BlackArch Linux, and pfSense firewall.
- Vulnerability scanning using Nmap and Nikto.
- Simulated attacks with Hydra and Metasploit.
- Traffic analysis and monitoring using Wireshark.
- Network hardening with strong password policies, firewall rules, and patch management.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Operating Systems:** BlackArch Linux, Ubuntu Server.
- **Tools:** 
  - Nmap: Network mapping and vulnerability scanning.
  - Nikto: Web server vulnerability analysis.
  - Hydra: Brute-force password attacks.
  - Metasploit: Exploitation framework.
  - Wireshark: Traffic capture and analysis.
  - pfSense: Firewall for traffic control and filtering.
- **Languages:** Shell scripting, Python (for automation).

## **Implementation Steps**
1. **Network Setup:**
   - Configured a virtual private network with VirtualBox, including Ubuntu Server (victim) and BlackArch Linux (attacker).
   - Set up pfSense as a gateway firewall.
2. **Vulnerability Assessment:**
   - Scanned network services using Nmap.
   - Analyzed web server vulnerabilities with Nikto.
3. **Exploitation:**
   - Brute-forced SSH credentials using Hydra.
   - Exploited services using Metasploit.
4. **Network Hardening:**
   - Implemented pfSense firewall rules to restrict traffic.
   - Enforced strong password policies and updated server software.
5. **Documentation:**
   - Generated vulnerability reports and proof-of-concept logs.
   - Summarized findings and mitigation strategies in a detailed report.

## **Deliverables**
- **Vulnerability Assessment Report:** Summarizing findings from Nmap and Nikto scans.
- **Exploitation Logs:** Screenshots and logs from Hydra and Metasploit.
- **Final Report:** Detailed documentation of vulnerabilities, exploits, and security measures.

## **Skills Gained**
- Network security configuration and management.
- Vulnerability scanning and exploitation techniques.
- Traffic monitoring and analysis.
- Firewall implementation and system hardening.

## **How to Use**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-network-security.git
   ```
2. Follow the step-by-step implementation guide included in the repository to replicate the project.
